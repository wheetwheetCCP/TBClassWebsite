            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>Sports have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Growing up all I wanted to do was go outside and play. I loved playing with my older brother and the kids around the neighborhood. Most of the time we would play American football and soccer. In the fall of the year 2000 was the beginning of what I like to humbly call, "my professional sports career," my first year being a part of a team. From 2000 to 2004 I played soccer at the army base my dad was station at in the Washington D.C. Area, but in 2005 we moved to a new city in Virginia, and thats when my soccer career was put on hiatus. In my new neighborhood the other kids played football, street hockey, and basketball, especially basketball. As I mentioned early I always played with my older brother who is four years older, but lucky me I was an early bloomer. I grew what must have been a whole foot that year. Basketball quickly grew on me so it wasn't long before I wanted to be on a team. The first team I played for was The greatest team ever assemble, "The Warriors!", ok no not the defending champs Golden State Warriors, but my local church team, "The Warriors." The following year I was back in a setting I was familiar with once again playing on the army base except this time I was in for quite the experience. I kid you not this has to be the most out there team name ever; you would never guess it! Ready?,"Refuse to Lose." no this is not just our motto this is really our team name,"Refuse to Lose." This is what all the other teams was going to see on the schedule, Team so and so versus "Refuse to Lose." So I remember coach asking us what do we want our team name to be so we all started calling out normal names such as the Magic, the Lions, etc... and Coach silences us and says, "Refuse to Lose." This was the strictest coach I ever had we did far more running and conditioning than actual playing basketball, but his philosophy paid off as we refused to lose every game but the championship. Although we lost the big game we held our heads high knowing we gave our best effort. After the game I was approach by an AAU(Aamateur Athletic Union) coach who was at the game scouting for players. He said he was impressed and offered me chance to tryout for his team. I was so excited and honored so I with all my enthusiasm I tried out for the team. My tryouts could not have gonna any better. I was the only new player to make the team and was given the nickname  "The Secret Weapon." Yet again this was a great season full through the ups and down, sadly it was my second time losing a championship game. There would be no redemption as my family and were moving once again, this time out of state. In 2006 I arrived in georgia, I was not happy about this I completly upset that I had to leave a place that I grew to love my friends, my coaches, teachers, and teammates I did not play any organized sports for two years, until I decided in the 8th grade to play basketball again and try out for 8th Grade boys Kennesaw Moutain Highschool team. This was a diffcult season as it was tough adjusting to the team and building the chemistry needed to be contenders. Entering Highschool I decided it was time for a change and went back to the sport that I first played. So Freshman year I tryout for the Kennesaw Mountain Soccer team.I played junior Varsity soccer my freshman and sophmore year, then by junior year I was on the Varsity team. Senior Year I was co-captain of the Kennesaw Mountain boys Varsity Soccer Team. We made it to the second round of playoffs which was better than the previous seasons so we all saw it as a success. This is the end of what I call my "professional sports career."</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is the gateway to the soul. It's a form of expression like no other. It can lift you up when your down, and can make you move all around. It's poetry where you can convey your thoughts and feelings. I love pretty much all genres but if I had to chose I would say Alternative Rock, Hip-Hop, and EDM (Electronic Dance Music) are my favorites. </p>

            <h2>Movies</h2>
            <p>Film is one the greatest art forms. They have an extraordinary capacity to expand our reality. It is the power of imagination that's what makes us unique. The ability to dream up new realities and share it with the world is amazing. There are a ton of movies I love. I would say movies from Marvel Studios are my favorites.</p>
