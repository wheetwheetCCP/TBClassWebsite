<p>CSS and html are two of the most interesting areas of technology I have ever been exposed to.  There are so many things you can do with both.  If you are creative, there are no limits to what you can design.  I hope I will be able to learn to use these tools adequately.  Right now I am struggling to understand enough to create a road map to follow.  In time, I'm sure I will be able to achieve my goal.</p>

<p>Growing up in Oklahoma was so much fun.  Being a military dependent, and living close to one of the largest Army bases in the United States, there were many advantages.  One summer, the mother of one of the neighborhood kids gathered a bunch of us together and took us to the base.  Little did we know, she enrolled us in a class for swimming lessons.  During the entire three months of summer, she would pick us up and drive us to the pool where the lessons were held.  I'm so glad she did.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1965, my aunt gave my family a beautiful little Dachshund.  His coat was red and we named him Noodle, after a story I had read in first grade.  There were two other Dachshunds living on the same street.  As a matter of fact, one lived right next door.  His name was Michael and he belonged to the Johnson family.  Mr. Johnson was the principal of my elementary school.  Michael was very "fluffy", black in color with brown markings.  The third Dachshund on the block was named George.  George belonged to the Hathaway family.  George was a carbon copy of Noodle.  They looked like they came from the same litter.  Watching the three pups play together was always a pleasure.</p>
